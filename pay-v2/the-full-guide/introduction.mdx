This tutorial guides you through a basic interaction with the Chargily Pay API.

First, you'll make your first API call to generate a new [Product](/pay-v2/api-reference/products/product-object "Product").

You will then create a [Price](/pay-v2/api-reference/prices/price-object "Price") for the Product you created, and use that Price to generate a [Checkout](/pay-v2/api-reference/checkouts/checkout-object "Checkout") to get the URL where you should redirect your customer to complete the payment.

Finally, you'll see how you can use the [Webhooks](/pay-v2/webhooks "Webhook") to let your website or application receive notifications from Chargily Pay when a payment is completed, failed, or canceled and react to it.

<Tip>
   Even though this tutorial guides you through creating a **Product**, setting
   a **Price**, and then creating a **Checkout**, you can also directly create a
   **Checkout** directly by specifying an `amount` and `currency` as parameters.
   You don't need to go through the steps of creating a **Product** and a
   **Price**. For more information, check out the [Checkout API
   reference](https://dev.chargily.com/pay-v2/api-reference/prices/create
   "checkout API reference").

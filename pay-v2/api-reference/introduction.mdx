Welcome to the API reference for Chargily Pay V2, where efficiency and simplicity meet seamless integration.

Our API is designed around REST, providing you with a streamlined and predictable experience.

Whether you're in the development phase or ready to go live, our API offers a dual-mode functionality. Utilize the test mode to experiment and fine-tune without impacting your live data or engaging with banking networks. The API URL and the secret key you provide will determine the mode of your request (live or test).

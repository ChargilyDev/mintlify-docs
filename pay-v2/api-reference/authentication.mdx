The Chargily Pay API uses API keys for request authentication. You can access and manage your API keys on [the Developers Corner page in the Chargily Pay Dashboard](https://pay.chargily.io/dashboard/developers-corner "the Developers Corner in the Chargily Pay Dashboard").

The secret key should be sent within an Authorization Bearer Header for each request.

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  Authorization header in the format of `Bearer [token]`, with `[token]` representing your API Secret Key.
  Example: `Bearer test_sk_Fje5EhFwyGTGqk4xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
</ParamField>

<Note>Requests made over plain HTTP (non HTTPS) and authentication-less (without providing an API key) will result in failure.</Note>

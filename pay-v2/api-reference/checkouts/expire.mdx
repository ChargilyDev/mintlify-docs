A Session can be expired only when it is not expired yet and its status is `pending`.


Once the Session expires, your customers are unable to pay, and those attempting to load it, will encounter a message indicating that it has expired.

## Returns

If the expiration succeeded, the Checkout object will be returned.

If the Checkout is already expired, a `400` error will be returned.

If the Checkout's status is not `pending`, a `403` forbidden error will be returned.

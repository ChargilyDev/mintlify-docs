By default, a Checkout expires automatically after 30 minutes. You can expire a Checkout manually by calling this endpoint.

A Session can be expired only when it is not expired yet and its status is `pending`.

Once the Session expires, your customers are unable to pay, and those attempting to load it will encounter a message indicating that it has expired.

## Path parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string">
   The ID of the checkout.
</ParamField>

## Returns

If the expiration succeeded, the Checkout object will be returned.

If the Checkout has already expired, a `400` error will be returned.

If the Checkout's status is not `pending`, a `403` forbidden error will be returned.

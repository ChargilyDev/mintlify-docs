You can start using your Chargily Pay account in [Test Mode](/pay-v2/test-and-live-mode "Test Mode") immediately after creating it. In this mode, you can simulate all of Chargily Pay's features without involving actual funds. To process real payments, you must activate your User Account and Application.

## 1. Verify your User Account

<Steps>
   <Step title="First Step">
      Enter your information on your [profile settings
      page](https://pay.chargily.io/test/dashboard/profile "profile settings
      page") then click on the **Update** button.

   <Step title="Third Step">

   </Step>
</Steps>

After your User Account is verified, you can switch to Live Mode, but you still need to verify your Application.

On Live Mode, while your Application is not yet verified, your checkout pages will have a message indicating that your Application is not yet verified.

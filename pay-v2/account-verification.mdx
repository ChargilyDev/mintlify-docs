You can start using your Chargily Pay account in [Test Mode](/pay-v2/test-and-live-mode "Test Mode") immediately after creating it. In this mode, you can simulate all of Chargily Pay's features without involving actual funds. To process real payments, you must activate your User Account and Application.

## 1. Verify your User Account

<Steps>
   <Step title="First Step">
      Enter your information on your [profile settings
      page](http://pay.chargily.com/test/dashboard/profile "profile settings
      page") then click on the **Update** button.

      On the same page, click on the **Verify my user account** button.

   <Step title="Third Step">
      Wait for a member of our team to review and approve your verification request.
   </Step>
</Steps>

After your User Account is verified, you can switch to Live Mode, but you still need to verify your Application.

On Live Mode, while your Application is not yet verified, your checkout pages will have a message indicating that your Application is not yet verified.

   </Step>
   <Step title="Third Step">

After your Application is verified, you can start accepting payments in Live Mode. And the warning message will no longer appear on your checkout pages.

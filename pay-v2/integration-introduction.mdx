This tutorial guides you through a basic interaction with the Chargily Pay API.

Integrating Chargily Pay on your website or application is straightforward, and this guide will make it even easier.

The guide is divided into two different micro-tutorials:

- **The Quick Guide:**
Focuses on the bare minimum staff needed to accept a payment. While concise, it covers everything necessary for most use cases.

- **The Full Guide:**
Covers all the features provided by Chargily Pay, including the creation of
Products, Prices and of course Checkouts.

<Tip>
For most use cases, **The Quick Guide** is enough, so just follow it if you want to get started quickly. If you need more advanced features, you can always come back to the Full Guide.

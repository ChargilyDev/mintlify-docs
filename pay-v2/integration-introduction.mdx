This tutorial guides you through a basic interaction with the Chargily Pay API.

First, you'll make your first API call to generate a new [Product](/pay-v2/api-reference/products/product-object "Product").  

You will then create a [Price](/pay-v2/api-reference/prices/price-object "Price") for the Product you created, and use that Price to generate a [Checkout](/pay-v2/api-reference/checkouts/checkout-object "Checkout") to get the URL where you should redirect your customer to complete the payment.

Finally, you'll see how you can use the [Webhooks](/pay-v2/webhooks "Webhook") to let your website or application receive notifications from Chargily Pay when a payment is completed, failed, or canceled and react to it.

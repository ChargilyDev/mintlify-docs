## What is a Webhooks?

A webhook is an HTTP request, triggered by an event in a source system and sent to a destination system, with a payload of data (an event object).

## Why do we need Webhooks?

You'll need your website or application to promptly receive events from Chargily Pay as they occur, enabling the execution of corresponding actions.

For example, when a customer successfully pays for an order, your website or application should be informed to update the order status to "Paid."

To inform your website or application, Chargily Pay sends a webhook, which is a HTTPS POST request with a JSON payload.

## Example webhook payload

Here is an example of a webhook payload of a successfully paid checkout:

```json Event Payload Example
{
   "id": "01hjjjzf7wbc454te45mwx35fe",
   "entity": "event",
   "livemode": "false"
   "type": "checkout.paid",
   "data": {
      "id": "01hjjj9aymmrwe664nbzrv84sg",
      "entity": "checkout",
      "fees": 1250,
      "amount": 50000,
      "locale": "ar",
      "status": "paid",
      "metadata": null,
      "created_at": 1703577693,
      "invoice_id": null,
      "updated_at": 1703578418,
      "customer_id": "01hjjjzf07chnbkcjax2vs58fv",
      "description": null,
      "failure_url": null,
      "success_url": "https://your-cool-website.com/payments/success",
      "payment_method": null,
      "payment_link_id": null,
      "pass_fees_to_customer": 1,
      "url": "https://pay.chargily.dz/test/checkouts/01hjjj9aymmrwe664nbzrv84sg/pay"
   },
   "created_at": 1703578418,
   "updated_at": 1703578418
}
```

## The structure of a webhook's payload

**type**:
The `type` key in the payload indicates the type of event that occurred, `checkout.paid` in the previous example which means that the event was triggered by a successfully paid checkout.

**data**:
The `data` key in the payload contains the object related to the event, the object that triggered the event. In the previous example, the event object is a Checkout.

## Create your webhook endpoint

You need to set up an endpoint on your backend that accepts POST requests so that Chargily Pay can send you the webhooks.

### What should your endpoint do

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verifying the signature">
    For security reasons, every webhook request sent to your endpoint from Chargily Pay will have a header called `signature`, which is a **HMAC** of the payload signed with your API secret key.  
    You need to verify it to make sure that the request came from us and that the payload hasn't been tampered with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify the event">
    Each request's payload comes with a `type` key that indicates the type of event that occurred, you can use it to identify the event and take the appropriate action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle the event">
    Once you've identified the event, you can handle it by executing the necessary actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond with a 200 response">
    After you've handled the event, you need to respond with a 200 response to let us know that you've received the webhook.
  </Step>
</Steps>


### Example endpoint

Here is an example of a webhook endpoint:

## Register your endpoint URL

To register your endpoint URL, go to [the Developers Corner page in the Chargily Pay Dashboard](https://pay.chargily.io/dashboard/developers-corner "the Developers Corner in the Chargily Pay Dashboard") and add the URL of your endpoint.

## Test your webhook endpoint locally

Chargily Pay can't send webhooks to your local server, so to test your webhook endpoint locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok") to make your local endpoint publicly accessible.

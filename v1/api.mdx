- Responses:

  - `201`: Payment created successfully

    Response as 'json': `checkout_url`

    Example: `{"checkout_url": "https://epay.chargily.com.dz/checkout/random_token_here"}`

  - `401`: Unauthorized

    Invalid `API_KEY`

  - `422`: Invalid parameters

    The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors

> If the creation of the invoice is successful, make redirection to `checkout_url`

## 2. Payment Confirmation

We will send you operation response via the already sent "webhook_url".

- Method `POST`

- Headers:

  `Signature`

- Body:

  Invoice with payment status

- Signature Validation:

  Incoming webhook request has a header that can be used to verify the payload. The name of the header containing the signature can be configured in the 'Signature' header key to validate signatures.

- This is an example of how you will compute the signature in PHP:

  ```php
  // Secret key can be found in your profile information
  $secret = "API_SECRET";
  // Get incoming webhook request body content
  $body_content = file_get_contents("php://input");
  //
  $computed_signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $body_content, $secret);
  // Get signature from header
  $signature = getallheaders()["Signature"];
  // Check computed signature
  $validated = hash_equals($computed_signature, $signature); // : bool

  if ($validated) {
      $payment = json_decode($body_content, true);
      //@Todo: check invoice status first ($payment["invoice"]["status"] === 'paid')
      if ($payment["invoice"]["status"] === 'paid') {
          //@Todo: confirm order
      } elseif ($payment["invoice"]["status"] === 'failed') {
          //@Todo: do anything when payment failed
      }
  }
  exit;
